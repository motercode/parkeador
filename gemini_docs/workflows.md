## New Project Creation Workflow:

1.  **Ask for Project Name:** I will ask the user for the name of the new project.
2.  **Create GitHub Repository:** I will use the `gh` CLI to create a new public repository under the `motercode` username and clone it locally. The command will be: `gh repo create motercode/<project-name> --public --clone`

## Logcat Issue Resolution Workflow:

1.  **Issue Creation:** When you ask me to solve an issue from the `@logcat` folder, I will first create a new issue on GitHub. The issue will contain the relevant logcat output and a summary of the problem.
2.  **Assign Issue:** I will assign the newly created issue to "motercode".
3.  **Branching:** I will create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name that includes the issue number (e.g., `fix/issue-123-camera-permission`).
4.  **Commits:** I will create atomic commits for each logical change. Each commit message will reference the issue number (e.g., "Fix #123: Request camera permission at runtime").
5.  **Merging:** Once the issue is resolved and the build is successful, I will merge the feature branch back into `main` using a squash merge.
6.  **Branch Deletion:** After the merge, I will delete the feature branch.
7.  **Comment on Issue:** Before closing the issue, I will add a comment summarizing the plan, the actions taken, and the final result.
8.  **Issue Closing:** Finally, I will close the GitHub issue.

4.  **Branching:** A new branch will be created from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/issue-123-new-feature`).
5.  **Development:** The feature will be developed following best practices.
6.  **Final Summary:** Before closing the issue, a comprehensive summary will be posted as a comment. This summary will include:
    *   A summary of the development process.
    *   A summary of any problems encountered and their resolutions.
    *   A list of any pending topics.

## Gradle Issue Resolution Workflow:

1.  **Branching:** For each Gradle issue (or a set of related issues), I will create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/gradle-deprecation-warning`).
2.  **Issue Summary:** In this new branch, I will create a file named `issue_summary.md` that contains a summary of the Gradle issue(s) and the plan to resolve them.
3.  **Commits:** I will create atomic commits for each logical change. This might be one or more commits, depending on the complexity of the issue. Each commit message will be clear and descriptive.
4.  **Merging:** Once the issue is resolved and the build is successful, I will merge the feature branch back into `main` using a squash merge. This will combine all the commits from the feature branch into a single, clean commit on the `main` branch.
5.  **Branch Deletion:** After the merge, I will delete the feature branch.
